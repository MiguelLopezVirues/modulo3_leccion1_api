## 📝 Project Overview

This project analyzes location-based data from Foursquare to uncover patterns, identify popular venues, and provide insights for improving urban planning and business decision-making.

The analysis covers venue distribution across various categories, user behavior trends, and how external factors such as seasonality influence visitation patterns.

Key objectives:

1. Understanding venue popularity and distribution across different areas.
2. Identifying opportunities for business and infrastructure development.
